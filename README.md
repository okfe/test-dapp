As a leading global Web3 wallet, OKX Wallet supports over 100 networks, including EVM series, UTXO series, Solana, Ton, and other popular networks. It also supports the latest ecosystems such as Ordinals.

In a DApp, adding a "Connect OKX Wallet" button allows interaction with the OKX Wallet, such as obtaining addresses, prompting wallet signatures, and more.

Here we are building seamlessly integrate the OKX Wallet with easeâ€”designed for developers, product managers, and DApp creators.
